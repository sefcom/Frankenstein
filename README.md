**Abstract:** Research Computing Infrastructures (RCIs) integrate high-performance computing, advanced data storage solutions, and sophisticated network protocols, connecting people, data, and computing resources to facilitate scientific collaboration in today’s data-driven world. Access control is essential in such highly collaborative environments to prevent resource misutilization, safeguard data integrity, and allocate resources effectively, thereby enabling secure and trusted interactions among different users. However, unlocking the full potential of RCIs for collaborative research through effective access control
requires more than technological exploration–it demands a deep, human-centered understanding of the stakeholders who operate and utilize these systems.

In this paper, we present the first qualitative study that explores the human dimensions of RCI interactions, drawing insights from $24$ key stakeholders, including researchers and system administrators, across $12$ research institutions to examine the collaborative practices, challenges, and needs with a focus on access control. Our findings reveal operational complexities and project-specific, trust-based resource-sharing dynamics, highlighting tensions between security and usability. Based on these insights, we provide stakeholder-driven recommendations and  requirements for adaptive, user-centered access control for RCIs, laying the groundwork for advancing human-centered security practices in RCIs.
